# **Contributing**

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Guidelines

1. Add tests for essential utilities.
2. Test your design's responsiveness on various screen sizes, especially small mobile screens.
3. Follow code conventions across the codebase.

## Commit Conventions

We use a simplified version of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

- this also applies to PRs

## Versioning Conventions

We take inspiration from [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface; this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, valid file locations and container parameters.
3. Your Pull Request will be merged to the preview environment by the maintainers once it's approved after review.
4. Your changes won't reflect on the main website until enough testers have confirmed the preview environment to be stable and usable and when the maintainers create a new release.

- by default, any merge to the `main` branch is a patch
- when the commit message has a `#minor` string, it will be a minor release
- `#major` applies the same way

## Issue Report Process

1. Go to the project's issues.
2. Select the template that better fits your issue.
3. Read the instructions carefully and write within the template guidelines.
4. Create a reproduction repository, if necessary.
5. Submit it and wait for support.
